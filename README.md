# PathTracer

This work is based on the frame of GAMES101 Assignment7. I commit the code in a private repository due to honor code.

I wrote an [introduction](./introduction.pdf) of the whole rendering pipeline.

For the learner, I recommend to read the reference repository and blog. They are much more detailed than mine.
